What is an interrupt?
An interrupt is a signal emitted by a device attached to a computer or from a program within the computer. It requires the operating system (OS) to stop and figure out what to do next. An interrupt temporarily stops or terminates a service or a current process. Most I/O devices have a bus control line called Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for this purpose

I. Hardware interrupt
A hardware interrupt is an electronic signal from an external hardware device that indicates it needs attention from the OS.

A software interrupt occurs when an application program terminates or requests certain services from the OS.
